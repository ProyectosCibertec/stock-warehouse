## Project setup

### Backend
First run the maven project in `backend` folder. You should have the following stuff previously installed in your system:

- MySQL (CLI or Workbench)
- Java 11 JDK
- A code editor or IDE of your preference

Once you install those programs, execute the SQL command found in `./backend/src/main/resources/Database.sql` to create the database. Next, copy the file `./backend/src/main/resources/.spring-boot-devtools.properties` into your home directory and make the changes you consider necessary. Finally execute the main method in the `app` module.
